# OpenVAF

OpenVAF is a framework that allows implementing compilers for VerilogA aimed predominantly at compact modelling.
The aim of this Project is to provide a high quality fully standard compliant compiler frontend for VerilogA.
Furthermore, it aims to bring modern compiler construction algorithms/data structures to a field with a lack of such tooling.
The goal is to allow the creation of open source static analysis tools and (JIT) compilers for the use in the field.

This book is intended to show off and document the features of OpenVAF that user of OpenVAF tools might interact with.
As such tool developers are encouraged to link to this book in their user documentation.

## API docs

If you wish to build a tool based upon OpenVAF or even contribute you may find the API documentation more useful:

* public [API doc](https://dspom.gitlab.io/OpenVAF/api_doc/open_vaf/index.html) (for tool developers)
* internal [API doc](https://dspom.gitlab.io/OpenVAF/dev_doc/open_vaf/index.html) (for OpenVAF developers)

## Contributing

OpenVAF is still under active development. As such you may encounter bugs when using OpenVAF based tools or find that features you required might be lacking.
In such cases please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/DSPOM/OpenVAF/-/issues) and potentially consider contributing!
