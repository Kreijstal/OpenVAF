Usage
-----

Depending which model one wants to use, one should compile one of the seven .va-files
(psp102.va, psp102b.va, psp102e.va, psp102_nqs.va, psp102b_nqs.va, and psp102e_nqs.va).
The module names are "PSP102VA" and "PSPNQS102VA" for the global PSP-model (QS and
NQS, respectively), and similarly "PSP102BVA" and "PSPNQS102BVA" for the binning
PSP-model, "PSP102EVA" and "PSPNQS102EVA" for the local PSP-model.

For the stand-alone version of JUNCAP2, version 200.4.0, please refer to the distribution
of PSP103.

Release notes vA-code of PSP 102.4.0 (December 2012)
----------------------------------------------------

Changes:

- The implementation of the thermal noise model has been improved:
    * a bug in the sign of the correlation coefficient for negative Vds was solved
    * Gummel symmetry of Sid at very high frequency was improved
    * number of white_noise sources was reduced and noise voltage values in noise-
      subcircuit where scaled to more physical values (no consequences for simulation
      results).
- Some minor implementation changes.
- Several OP-output variables were added.

PSP 102.4.0 is backwards compatible with the previous version, PSP 102.3.4.

The authors want to thank Laurent Lemaitre and Colin McAndrew (Freescale)
for their help with ADMS and the implementation of the model code. Geoffrey
Coram (Analog Devices) is acknowledged for input concerning the Verilog-A
implementation of the model.
