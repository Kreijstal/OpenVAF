# VARF

A Verilog-AMS frontend written in rust

Note this project is still in extremly early development and is being developed as a frontend to another Project (name TBD) which will replace ADMS for compact modelling. Therefor the development is focused on supporting the small subset of Verilog-A that ADMS currently supports (with optional future expansion)
