# OpenVAF-reloaded

OpenVAF is a Verilog-A compiler written by Pascal Kuthe. The compiler outputs a dynamic library whose functionality can be acessed via the OSDI API (version 0.3). The original compiler received no support since end of 2023. This fork of [the original repository](https://github.com/pascalkuthe/OpenVAF) was started by Árpád
Bűrmen in early 2024. Since then several small bugs were fixed that prevented the use of OpenVAF for building SPICE3 equivalent device models. 

New functionality will be added to OpenVAF in the future. In order to achieve this the OSDI interface was modified to accommodate the changes. Consequently the current version of OSDI API is 0.4. OSDI API 0.4 differs from version 0.3 in the module descriptor. It also exports `OSDI_DESCRIPTOR_SIZE` which can be used to traverse the array of descriptors without relying on the definition of the `OsdiDescriptor` structure. New members are added after the first part of the descriptor which still complies with OSDI specification v0.3. Simulators that rely on OSDI v0.3 can still use compiled models using the newer OSDI API by applying some minor changes. 

The last version of OpenVAF before the project was renamed to **OpenVAF-reloaded** and the binary was renamed to `openvaf-r` is tagged with `osdi_0.3`. Currently two branches are maintained: `master` branch using the OSDI 0.4 API and a branch named `branches/osdi_0.3` using the old OSDI 0.3 API. Both branches include bugfixes by Geoffrey Coram and Dietmar Warning with the exception of [477e71c](https://github.com/pascalkuthe/OpenVAF/commit/477e71c8b2fcf146d0e0ff2cb7a67580c2241669) which crashes when compiling Cogenda BSIM4 with `__XYCE_VAMS__` not defined. 


# OSDI 0.4

In OSDI 0.4 new members are added to the module descriptor data structure after the members defined in the OSDI specification v0.3. The descriptor (if cast to the declaration given in the OSDI 0.3 header file) remains compatible with OSDI 0.3 and should work just like before. Simulators using OSDI API 0.3 can be adapted to use version 0.4 by applying the following changes 
- allowing major.minor version >=0.4 beside 0.3, 
- reading the `OSDI_DESCRIPTOR_SIZE` symbol of type `uint32` specifying the descriptor size, 
- making sure the table of descriptors (pointed to by the `OSDI_DESCRIPTORS` symbol) is traversed in steps of size `OSDI_DESCRIPTOR_SIZE` instead of `sizeof(OsdiDescriptor)`, and
- casting each descriptor to the structure declared in the OSDI header file, version 0.3. 

This is the current state of OSDI 0.4 support

|Simulator|OSDI version supported|Comment|
|---------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|Ngspice 42     |0.3         |patch for 0.4 support submitted, uses only 0.3 features        |
|SPICE OPUS 3.0 |0.3         |                                                               |
|VACASK 0.1.2   |0.3         |                                                               |
|VACASK dev     |0.4         |                                                               |

If you know of any other simulator supporting OSDI models generated by OpenVAF, let me know. 

Some internals of the OpenVAF compiler are documented in the [internals.md](internals.md) file. 

## What is new in OSDI 0.4? 

- OSDI descriptor size for traversing the OSDI descriptor table in simulators not supporting OSDI 0.4 
- Support for reading param given flags of parameters in the instance and model data structures. This is pretty much self-explanatory. Look at the [OSDI 0.4 header file](openvaf/osdi/header/osdi_0_4.h). This one takes care of issue #76 in the original repository. 
- Support for writing nonzero resistive and reactive Jacobian contributions to an array of doubles. 
- List of model inputs (node pairs) that produce a nonlinear response. 


# What about binaries? 

Yes, binaries for 64-bit Linux and Windows are available [here](https://fides.fe.uni-lj.si/openvaf/download). The naming scheme of the binaries is 

```
openvaf-reloaded-<version>-<platform>
```

The version name is generated with `git --describe`. The OpenVAF-reloaded that produces models with the OSDI API v0.3 is version `osdi_0.3`. All newer versions (`osdi_0.4`) produce models with OSDI API v0.4. 

If the binary is named `openvaf` it comes from the `osdi_0.3` branch and produces models with the OSDI 0.3 API. If the binary is named `openvaf-r` it comes from the `master` branch and produces models with the OSDI 0.4 API. 


# Building OpenVAF-reloaded

## Setting up the dependencies under Debian Bookworm

Get [LLVM 15 built by Pascal](https://openva.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/llvm-15.0.7-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-FULL.tar.zst) 
(do not use the Debian-supplied version). You can also build your own LLVM and Clang 15.0.7 from 
[sources](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-15.0.7).  

Unpack Pascal's binaries in `/opt` as root (creates directory `/opt/LLVM`). You will need zstd for that. 
```
cd /opt
zstd -d -c --long=31 <path/to/archive.tar.zst> | tar -xf -
```
Install Rust as ordinary user (files will go to `~/.cargo` and `~/.rustup`). 
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
During installation select "Customize installation" and set profile to "complete". 

Set LLVM_CONFIG, add LLVM to PATH, and set up the working environment for Rust.
Add these lines at the end of `.bashrc`
```
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
export LLVM_CONFIG=/opt/LLVM/bin/llvm-config
export PATH=/opt/LLVM/bin:$PATH
```

Restart shell. You're good to go. 


## Setting up the dependencies under Windows

Download [rustup](https://win.rustup.rs), run it to install Rust. 
During installation select "Customize installation" and set profile to "complete". 

Install Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (tested with version 16.11.33) 
Make sure you install CMake Tools that come with VS2019 (also installs Ninja). 

Build LLVM and Clang, download [LLVM 15.0.7](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-15.0.7) sources (get the .zip file)

Unpack the sources. This creates directory `llvm-project-llvmorg-15.0.7`. Create a directory named `build`. 

Start Visual Studio x64 native command prompt. 
Run CMake, use Ninja as build system. Do not use default (nmake) because for me it always built the Debug version, even when I specified Release. 
Replace `e:\llvm` with the path where you want your LLVM and Clang binaries and libraries to be installed. 
```
cmake -G Ninja -S llvm-project-llvmorg-15.0.7\llvm -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=e:\LLVM -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;ARM;AArch64" -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="llvm;clang"
```
Run Ninja (build and install)
```
ninja -C build
ninja -C build install 
```
Now you have your own LLVM and Clang. Hope it did not take too many Snickers :). 

The LLVM and Clang version [built by Pascal](https://openva.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/llvm-15.0.7-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc-FULL.tar.zst) did not work for me (the openvaf binary failed to link due to undefined symbols). 

Add LLVM to the PATH (in the above example that would be `e:\llvm\bin`). 
Set the `LLVM_CONFIG` environmental variable if you have multiple LLVM installations
(for the above example that would be `e:\llvm\bin\llvm-config.exe`). 

Restart command prompt. Now you are good to go. 


## Building

To build the release version (`target/release/openvaf-r`), type
```
cargo build --release --bin openvaf-r
```

To build the debug version (`target/debug/openvaf-r`), type
```
cargo build --bin openvaf-r
```
